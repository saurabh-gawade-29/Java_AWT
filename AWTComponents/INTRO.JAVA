//! Java AWT Tutorial
/*
*Java AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) 
is a part of Java's standard library, specifically within the java.awt package,
that provides a set of APIs for creating and managing graphical user interfaces (GUIs). 
AWT was one of the original libraries in Java for building desktop applications and 
is platform-independent, leveraging the native GUI toolkit of the operating system.

*Key Features of Java AWT:
Platform Independence: AWT components are mapped to native components of the operating system using the operating system's windowing system, ensuring a consistent look and feel.
Basic GUI Components: It provides essential building blocks like windows, buttons, labels, text fields, checkboxes, and menus.
Event Handling: AWT includes a robust event-handling mechanism, allowing developers to handle user interactions like clicks, keypresses, and mouse movements.
Graphics Support: It provides classes for rendering shapes, images, and text, making it suitable for drawing and simple graphical applications.
Layout Management: AWT offers layout managers like FlowLayout, BorderLayout, and GridLayout for arranging components in a container.

*Commonly Used Classes in AWT:
Frame: Represents a main application window.
Panel: A generic container to hold components.
Button: A clickable button.
Label: Displays a non-editable text string.
TextField: Allows single-line text input.
Checkbox: Represents a checkbox.
Canvas: Provides a drawing area for custom graphics.
Graphics: Used for drawing shapes and images.
